<h2>About Me</h2>


<p> I've just graduated from the University of Oxford with an MChem in Chemsitry where I developed an interest in computational chemistry, covariance imaging and instrument development.
In October I will be starting a PhD at Imperial College working on Mueller matrix polarimetry of optoelectronic materials with Prof Fuchter at Imperial College and Giuliano Siligardi at Diamond.</p>
