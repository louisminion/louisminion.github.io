<h2>About Me</h2>


<p>I'm a first year PhD student at Imperial College London working with Professor Matthew Fuchter and Dr Jess Wade on novel chiroptical imaging, including working together with the B23 lab at Diamond to develop Mueller Matrix polarimetry. 
My undergraduate degree was from the  University of Oxford with an MChem in Chemistry where I developed an interest in computational chemistry, covariance imaging and instrument development, and completed my Master's research in the lab of Dr Michael Burt.
